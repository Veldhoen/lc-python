    "When you do a free text search, this generally means that you want to find all the passages containing occurrences of a given search term. In other words, you test whether the exact character sequence that makes up the search term is contained within the text you analyse. Such text searches based on exact terms can be helpful if you want to find fragments containing a specific word. They are not so helpful if you want to retrieve specific categories of information. If you want to extract all the recent years that are mentioned in a text, for example, it would clearly be impractical to supply all possible options. In this situation, you know that you need to extract sequences of four digits. Similarly, if you want to extract all the email addresses that are mentioned within a text, you don’t know the exact characters that make up these email addresses beforehand, but you do know that you need to find strings that contain the ‘at’ symbol ('@') and a period ('.'). In situations such as these, it can be very useful to search on the basis of regular expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns within texts. When you search using patterns, rather than exact search terms, you can generally search in much more advanced ways. You can search for words with specific types of characters or for words containing a specific number of characters, for instance. Such regular expressions typically consist of a sequence of symbols to define a pattern or a search action. Once defined, such regular expressions can be matched against actual strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be constructed using literal characters and so-called metacharacters. Literal characters are simply the characters that are used to compose regular words. The simple regular expression ‘flower’, for instance, only contains literal characters. It can be used to search for the actual six characters that are mentioned. Metacharacters, by contrast, are characters with a special meaning. They represent specific types of characters, such as characters in upper case, digits, spaces or tabs. You can also use metacharacters to specify how many times these characters can appear occur in the pattern. \n",
